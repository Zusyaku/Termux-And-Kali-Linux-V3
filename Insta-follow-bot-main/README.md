# Insta-follow-bot

An instagram bot developed in Python with Selenium that helps you get more Instagram followers.
## Install
You’ll need to have:

 - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
 - [Selenium](https://pypi.org/project/selenium)
 - [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
 - [Chromedriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

Go check them out if you don't have them locally installed.

If you have correctly downloaded Chromedriver and install.

## Usage

Open **instafollowbot.py** , you’ll have to change some lines.

Step 1. Change your_username and your_password to your Instagram credentials.
```
#
username = 'Your Username'
password = 'Your Password'
```
Step 2. Change this line with your custom tags.
```
#
tags = ['palashu','instafollower','instalover','bot']
```
Step 3. In order to keep your account safe and not locked out, you should be satisfied with less than 500 likes per day.
```python
#
while  like_cnt < 500:
	like()
```
4. Run
```
 instafollowbot.py
```
